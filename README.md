# Resumé 
My resume, written in LaTeX

### Installation 

This is the fairly basic ModernCV template.  On Ubuntu, you need to install LaTeX using the `texlive` package, along with the `texlive-latex-extra` package: 

```
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra
```

Then you should be able to run it: 

```
pdflatex resume.tex
```

...Or you could just download the PDF that's in the repo.  That's cool too.

I realized that I was getting annoyed at constantly having to paroose through old emails to find a copy of my resumé, and I realized there's no reason I couldn't happily store it on GitHub.
